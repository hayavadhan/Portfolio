            Owing to a tight deadline Hayavadhan suggested to use a CSS framework instead of designing<br>UI elements from scratch and focus on task flows and usability issues. 
            This was one of the quickest<br>product launches (took less than 4 weeks).An updated version of the app was also launched after<br>analysing product metrics and incredible insights from customer feedback.
